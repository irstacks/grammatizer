    value: Mr Albee was not particularly concerned with appearances, either personal
      or effectual. It was his position, taken quietly and fundamentally as a kind
      of vague moralistic attitude, that the important things were the invisible things,
      and that, excusing the cliché (as he sometimes repeated in earnest collegiate
      conversations) - one does not judge a book by its cover. "Perhaps just the title,"
      he would quip, raising an eyebrow and lightening the mood, gently urging the
      subtle jealous abstraction to disappear into the next thing.

    value: His wife was different. She considered herself a realist, which really
      meant materialist, and she placed great value in her empirical capacities. As
      a result she was quick to judge, but life experience had also taught her a willingness
      to revise her intuitions with reason. She was open and engaging and exceptionally
      eloquent with company and companions, and won the admiration of many and at
      least the respect of all. Early practice in handling the world around her with
      immediacy had taught her tact at an early age, and even her peers in primary
      school had noticed her social grace, rooted in a very natural feminine empathy.

      very secretly considering himself her superior in the genre. She, on the other
      hand, found him radiant in an academic kind of way, subtly absent, but indeed
      a fine partner.

      individuals can be claimed to, and that was the matter of their perpetual boat,
      now The Duchess. Having both been raised in Providence, and both of bourgeois
      families, the two had grown up by the ocean (though they didn't meet in person
      until their university times, where they had recognized each others' names and
      privately neither thought it a pity they hadn't met sooner) and it had been
      both of their wishes to remain forever on the coast, which they did.

      homogeny. The land: the obvious, tangible, populous, and practical. What a thin
      boundary it is.'

    value: Money being an ultimate watery abstraction, and man never so deeply keen
      to lose sight of land, the club and its physical accessories were a constant
      reassurance to yachters in both social and ethical ways. Men who work sitting
      down crave things like the smell of marine fuel and slimy, weathered ropes and
      the occasional blisters they get from them and seeing the rubber bumpers bulge
      with the pressure of a 15-ton sailboat siding to the dock. Mr Albee uniquely
      savored a window seat in the marina restaurant on windy days and watching the
      square docks with their buoyant luggage bob in the circumsized waves, and how
      the dock boys, he noticed, would be slightly on edge, grouped more closely than
      usual by the fuel pumps, waiting to see if rain would come or something would
      happen.

      but rather an iteration of conscious choices which serve order before precision.
      It is a homogenization, a unification, and when the mind is secured by a notion
      of the invisible, the world does not change so much with each blink, and the
      man may become more the man. Indeed, simple eyelids may not shut the world out,
      but keep it in, cloaked in the burning black.

      loose, given that a significant, though now decreasing, portion of his life
      was dedicated to the jurisdictional reverie, and the summertime was one of the
      rare select. The indulgences the elite enjoy with regard to alcohol can be understood
      on the order of their attraction to yachts; as a sort of spotless noblesse obligé,
      granted in and by those lofty pitches and sinking throws, where the ugly, thrilling
      brutish charisma can be glimpsed and the primacy of fingers and hands, skulls
      and teeth can be felt and thus understood, legitimated by what are essentially
      petty material circumstances.

      in Myrtle Beach. The whole trip would take three weeks, and he had scheduled
      the time off work in December. They had done something like this before, oh,
      ten or twelve years ago. And with his seniority now three weeks was no problem
      and he could have gotten longer if he wanted it, but she had felt obliged to
      get back to accompany a former colleague and friend of hers to a Saturday-night
      Dixie Chicks concert in Atlantic City. Like old times, you know.

      glasses of Argentinian Malbec, the sun was less bright, visible only as a thin
      horizontal tangent over the far-away US. Soon it disappeared, leaving soft technicolor
      reflections in the sky, and they were alone, finally. Cheers.
